You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

SPOF
The Single point of failure for this infrastructure is the server.
If any of the servers fails, the entire system fails.

Downtime when maintenance needed
(like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)

During maintenance of any of the servers (web server, app server, db server),
the clients would experience downtime for all of the servers because
the servers are not separated.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
This infrastructure cannot be scaled if there is too much traffic because
there is only one server to handle all incoming traffic.
