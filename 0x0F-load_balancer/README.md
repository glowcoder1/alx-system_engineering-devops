# 0x0F. Load balancer

## Background Context
You have been given 2 additional servers:

Let's improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers.
This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number
of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server
fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.
